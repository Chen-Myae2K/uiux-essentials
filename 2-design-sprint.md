## 💡Design Sprint Brief

### Sprint Brief

- a document the you share with all your attendees to help them prepare for the sprint

### DESIGN SPRINT BRIEF

SPRINT CHALLENGE: Build exciting new features for the cycling app in time for relaunch later in the year

What is the challenge that you want to solve in the sprint?

Here are four things that make a great challenge:

- The challenge is something **real** that the team needs to deliver
- It's stated in a way that sounds **inspiring** - something to solve for
- It's **clear and concise**
- It includes a **time frame** (next quarter? 3 years from now?)

Example: Build an exciting new feature for a cycling app in time for relaunch later in the year.

---

### KEY DELIVERABLES: ………

What do you want the team to create during the sprint?

A few tips for deliverables:

- Aim for the highest quality deliverables possible. Polished digital work, videos, and interactive prototypes are better than sketches.
- List all platforms that need to be designed for - e.g., web, mobile, tablet / physical product + website / environment.

Example: Complete prototype that includes the feature update. Or user journey flows for X and Y.

Who: [list at end of doc - bookmark]

Sprint Master: (the person who sent out the brief)

### APPROVERS:

Internal Stakeholder(s):

Who needs to sign off on the project so it can launch?

We want to include this person's view in the sprint, so we can plan a path to launch that's fast and smooth.

---

### RESOURCES:

For short term sprints: Assignment development team, if any:

It's recommended that you start a design sprint by having assigned development resources to carry the work after the sprint. This is easier in the case of short-term focused sprints.

For long-term / vision sprints: Plan to secure resources:

Vision sprints take a long-term view of planning. In order to succeed, our team needs to have a plan of approvals for how to integrate the sprint within the organizational roadmap.

---

### PROJECT OVERVIEW:

1. Current state of the project

What's been created already?

If this is a new project with no history, say so. If this is a 4 year project with lots of history, summarize.

2. Roadblocks

What stands in our way?

3. Early wins, if any.

Has our team demonstrated any wins or learnings in the space already?

4. Estimated launch plan

When is the projected launch for the piece we are designing?

What is this likely to look like at launch - e.g., a website, campaign, service, physical product. Be sure to list that in the challenge statement as well.
