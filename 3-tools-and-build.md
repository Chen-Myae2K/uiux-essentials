- **Cognitive load:** Keep tasks simple.
- **Accessibility:** Design for everyone.

### **2. Mental Model**

A **mental model** is the picture in a user’s mind of how something works.

Users come with expectations based on past experiences.

**Example:**

People think a **trash bin icon = delete**, because that’s how it works everywhere else.

### **3. Positive Feedback Loop**

A **positive feedback loop** makes an action **increase** or **grow** over time.

**example :**

- You turn on the light
- The room becomes brighter
- The brightness shows the action worked
    
    ➡️ **Result: Light increases (action and result go in the same direction).**
    

### **4. Negative Feedback Loop**

A **negative feedback loop** **reduces** or **controls** an action to keep things stable.

**example:**

- You turn on the light
- The room is still dark
- You adjust: increase the brightness / add another light / fix the bulb
    
    ➡️ **Result: The system tries to reduce the darkness (action and result balance).**
